This repository contains a VHDL code example demonstrating a common bug related to counter synchronization and glitch susceptibility. The bug.vhd file shows the problematic code, while bugSolution.vhd provides a corrected version.  The issue arises from unsynchronized enable signals, leading to unpredictable counter behavior. The solution involves proper synchronization techniques to ensure reliable counter operation.
